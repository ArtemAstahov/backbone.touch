{"tagline":"Enable faster click events on touch devices for Backbone views","body":"Backbone.touch\r\n==============\r\n\r\nMonkey patch Backbone.View to enable fast tap events on touch devices.\r\n\r\n## Usage ##\r\n\r\nBackbone.touch is made to work with your existing views.\r\nIt replaces the `delegateEvents` method and replaces any *click* event\r\nwith the three events *touchstart*, *touchmove* and *touchend* when a touch\r\ndevice is used. Once the touchend fires your callback is executed without the\r\n300ms delay that the *click* event has.\r\n\r\n## Download & Include ##\r\n\r\n### Bower install\r\n\r\n`bower install backbone.touch`\r\n\r\n### Manual download\r\n\r\n* [Development](https://raw.github.com/nervetattoo/backbone.touch/master/backbone.touch.js)\r\n* [Production](https://raw.github.com/nervetattoo/backbone.touch/master/dist/backbone.touch.min.js)\r\n\r\nDepends on Underscore, Backbone and jQuery.  You can swap out the \r\njQuery dependency completely with a custom configuration.\r\n\r\nInclude in your application *after* jQuery, Underscore, and Backbone have been\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\n``` html\r\n<script src=\"/js/jquery.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"/js/underscore.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"/js/backbone.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n<script src=\"/js/backbone.touch.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that backbone.touch currently overwrites `Backbone.View` to make its usage\r\na no-op part from including it.\r\n\r\n## Release notes ##\r\n\r\n### 0.2 ###\r\n\r\n* Register as an anonymous AMD module\r\n\r\n### 0.1 ###\r\n\r\n* Initial release.
